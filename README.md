# Tetris 

 > The basic gameplay of Tetris involves manipulating falling tetrominoes, which are geometric shapes
made up of four squares arranged in various configurations. The tetrominoes fall from the top of 
the game screen, and the player must rotate and position them to fit together with the blocks 
already on the screen, forming complete rows without any gaps. Once a complete row is formed, 
it disappears, and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space. As the game progresses, the 
tetrominoes fall faster and faster, and the player must think and move quickly to keep up. If the 
player allows the blocks to pile up to the top of the screen, the game ends.
Tetris is known for its simple yet addictive gameplay.
